# Defence Notes Arena

[Live Website on Netlify](https://notes-arena.netlify.app/)

This project is a 100% pure HTML educational website for Defence Notes, designed for maximum compatibility and simplicity. No CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used anywhere in the project—neither external, internal, nor inline. All styling and layout are achieved using only HTML attributes and tags.

## Features
- **Pure HTML Only**: No CSS files, no `<style>` tags, and no `style` attributes. All formatting uses HTML attributes like `bgcolor`, `align`, `width`, `height`, and `<font>` tags.
- **Navigation**: Consistent navigation bar on every page using HTML tables and spacing with `&nbsp;`.
- **Footer**: Shared footer (via iframe) with copyright, X (Twitter) and email icons/links.
- **Lecture Pages**: Individual pages for each lecture, playlist, mindmap, and contact form—all styled with HTML only.
- **No JavaScript**: The site is static and does not use any JavaScript.

## Folder Structure
- `index.html` – Main landing page
- `playlist.html` – Video playlist
- `contact.html` – Contact form
- `lec1.html` to `lec5.html` – Individual lecture pages
- `mindmap.html` – Mindmap visualization
- `footer.html` – Shared footer (embedded via iframe)
- Images (`.png`, `.jpg`) for logos and mindmaps

## How to Use
Just open `https://notes-arena.netlify.app/` in any web browser. All navigation and content will work without any server or build process.
